# MAME Tool

This is the tool that is my task runner for MAME. It's a form with a button for each task :)

## Assumptions

- Your mame folder is here: c:\mame

## Installation

You have to build from source ("Rom Info" is the project name). 
This was authored in the free Visual Studio 2015 community edition:

Then run the .exe. Click the first button to produce the XML and when it's done click the second to produce 
the roms.csv.

## Extending

This supports a windows MAME client:
